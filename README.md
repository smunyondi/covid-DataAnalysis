# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project explores and visualizes COVID-19 data at a global scale using the `owid-covid-data.csv` dataset. It performs initial data loading and then creates a choropleth map to illustrate the total number of COVID-19 cases by country.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Load and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset.
* Visualize the global distribution of total COVID-19 cases using a choropleth map.
* Provide a clear and informative representation of the pandemic's impact across different countries.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * Pandas (`pd`) for data manipulation and analysis.
    * Matplotlib.pyplot (`plt`) for plotting.
    * Seaborn (`sns`) for enhanced visualizations.
    * Plotly.express (`px`) for creating interactive choropleth maps.

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```

2.  **Notebook Execution:**
    * Download the `covid-nb.ipynb` notebook and the `owid-covid-data.csv` dataset.  (Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file path in the notebook).
    * Open the notebook in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code with the Python extension, or any other environment that can run `.ipynb` files.
    * Run the notebook cells sequentially. The choropleth map will be displayed as an output after the relevant cells are executed.

## Insights and Reflections

* The project provides a basic visualization of the total COVID-19 cases. Further analysis could explore trends over time, correlations with other factors (e.g., vaccination rates, demographics), and regional comparisons.
* The use of Plotly's choropleth map allows for interactive exploration, enabling users to hover over countries for detailed information.
* The initial data exploration reveals the structure of the dataset, which includes a wide range of information related to COVID-19.
